## delete-myob-purchase.ahk
AutoHotkey v2 automation script that reads purchase codes from an Excel file and processes them in MYOB AccountRight.  
For each code, the script searches the purchase, opens the record, prompts for confirmation, and deletes or skips it.  
Designed for semi-automated batch cleanup with manual verification and hotkeys for pause or exit.
